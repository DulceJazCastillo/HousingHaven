# Overview 
Housing Haven is a chatbot that provides users with affordable housing resources.

# Affordable Housing Problem
Being college students, we understand that it is difficult for many students and graduate students to be able to afford housing. With rising tuition costs, limited financial aid, and rent being too high can create obstacles to afforable accomodations. This issue not only affects a student's academic performance, but it can also affect their mental health and well being. 

# Why Choose Housing Haven?
Our project’s main objective is to build a functional and informational chatbot that provides our users with affordable housing resources that are customized to their needs. Housing Haven is location based, has streamlines expectations, customer support, and government assistance matching based on user information. Our chatbot is composed of three key features that gives user’s personalized housing recommendations, provides affordable housing locations, and has a roommate matching feature.
